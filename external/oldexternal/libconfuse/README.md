Introduction
------------

libConfuse is a configuration file parser library written in C.  It
supports sections and (lists of) values, as well as other features such
as single/double quoted strings, environment variable expansion,
functions and nested include statements.  Values can be strings,
integers, floats, booleans, and sections.

The goal is not to be _the_ configuration file parser library with a
gazillion of features.  Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to
integrate with your code.

Documentation
-------------

* [API reference manual](http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/manual/)
* [Tutorial](http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/tutorial-html/)


Examples
--------

* [simple.c](examples/simple.c) and [simple.conf](examples/simple.conf)
  shows how to use the "simple" versions of options
* [cfgtest.c](examples/cfgtest.c) and [test.conf](examples/test.conf)
  show most of the features of confuse, including lists and functions


Build & Install
---------------

libConfuse employs the GNU configure and build system.  To list available
build options, start by unpacking the tarball:

    tar xf confuse-3.2.2.tar.xz
    cd confuse-3.2.2/
    ./configure --help

For most users the following commands configures, builds and installs the
library to `/usr/local/`:

    ./configure && make -j9
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

See the INSTALL file for the full installation instructions.

When checking out the code from GitHub, use <kbd>./autogen.sh</kbd> to
generate a `configure` script.  This means you also need the following
tools:

* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* gettext
* autopoint
* flex

To build the documentation you also need the following tools:

* doxygen
* xmlto

This is an optional step, so you must build it explicitly from
its directory:

    cd doc/
    make documentation


Origin & References

libConfuse was created by Martin Hedenfalk and released as open source
software under the terms of the [ISC license][1].  It was previously
called libcfg, but the name was changed to not confuse with other
similar libraries.  It is currently developed and maintained at GitHub.
