# iocod

iocod is an open source implementation of Call of Duty™ and United Offensive.
It is based on the GPL releases of Q3 Arena, RTCW MP, and others.

## Expected feature set

- DDoS packet protection
- Exploit & crash fixes
- New scripting functionality
    - ~100-150 new script functions
    - extended scripting language support (`#include` directives, `foreach()`,
      etc.)
    - script features from CoD2+
- Support for larger maps, more weapons, mods, gametypes
- Q3 Arena-like bot implementation
- Autodownloading / WWW downloads for faster redirects (like 1.5)
- Module support (add your own features and script functions)
- Tons of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements
- Potential stuff to be implemented:
    - 1.1 & 1.5 intercompatibility - i.e. 1.1 players can play on 1.5 servers 
      and vice-versa
    - UO 1.41/1.51 compatibility - i.e. UO players can play on 1.1/1.5 servers
    - new map compiler to support even larger maps
- ... and many more!
