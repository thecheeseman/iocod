TODO
----
- update MAX_QPATH to something modern (like 256)
- figure out how to parse terrain data
- general naming conventions for folders and files
    - remove any prefixes e.g. `common_` or `server_`
	- just simplify naming so that each file is named what it needs to be
	- shorter names are preferred
- game dll
    - as above, separate into more folders to make it cleaner
    - scripts
		- separate into game/script folder
		- set up `scr_farhook` in game dll
		- implement shells of gsc functions
		- module support?
- implement OOB / networking so server can at least send/receive packets
- files_io:372 // TODO: whatever this is // fun_080612a2(*file);
